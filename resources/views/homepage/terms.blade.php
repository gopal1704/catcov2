                              <p style="text-align:justify;">Each buy or sell of any financial assets done by us through the Service (the “Transaction”) is subject to the prices, expiration periods and payout amounts and other terms quoted by the Service at the time of entering into a Transaction. Each Transaction is comprised of an offer by you to enter into the Transaction, and our subsequent acceptance of your offer evidenced by withdrawal of monies from your account with us on the Service (the “Account”) in the amount indicated by you in your offer. A Transaction will be deemed to have been consummated only when your offer has been received and accepted by us, as evidenced by withdrawal of monies from your Account. We may, in our sole discretion, accept or reject all or any part of an offer by you to enter into a Transaction. We may offer to and impose on each user, in our sole discretion, different terms and restrictions with respect to their use of the Service.
Each Transaction must be processed manually by you through the Service only, and not by any automatic system. Other offers, such as offers sent by fax, email or text message, will not be accepted.
If during the term between the purchasing and the expiration of a Transaction relating to a stock as the underlying asset, the stock has been split or there is a reverse split, then such option’s price will be adjusted according to the adjustments made to the stock price in the Exchange where it is traded due to such split or reverse split.
We reserve the right to void any Transaction which we believe to be based on an obvious error, or fraudulent, including without limitation offers to execute Transactions for exaggerated amounts.
It is your obligation to ensure that you fully comply with all applicable laws, and directives with regard to the use of the Site and the Service. For avoidance of doubt, the ability to access our Site or the Service does not necessarily mean that the Site or the Service and your use thereto are legal under relevant laws, regulations and directives. Further, use of the Service is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement.
Any downloads of software from the Site or from authorized third party websites, which enable you to access the Service, including without limitation any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software, (the “Software”) is licensed to you by us or third-party licensors for your personal, non-commercial use only. You shall keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices and your use of such Software is strictly subject to the terms of this Agreement and any agreement accompanying the Software.
Payments, Transfers and Taxes. All payments in connection with the Site or Service are non-refundable and non-cancelable. <br>
Upon entering into a Transaction, the amounts used to enter into a Transaction shall be immediately withdrawn from your Account and held by us pending expiry of the Transaction. You shall not be allowed to enter into a Transaction for any amount in excess of the balance in your Account. You hereby declare that the moneys invested in your Account with us do not originate from any illegal activity.
In the event that you are entitled to monies at the expiration of a Transaction, such amounts shall be added to your Account.<br>
You hereby authorize us to hold your funds in any financial institution we choose in our sole discretion. You shall not be entitled to, nor shall your credit balance in your Account bear, any interest. Any funds to be paid to you in respect of an expired Transaction shall be paid in the same currency as initially deposited into your Account by you.
Other than the applicable amount payable to you upon the expiration of a Transaction, you shall not be entitled to any further payment of any kind whatsoever.
The Service, including without limitation payment processing, may be handled directly by us or by online third parties.<br>
We may charge a fee for transfers to or from your Account, as published through the Service from time to time. Such fees shall be deducted from your Account immediately upon execution of a transfer, without notice to you. You shall be responsible for expenses in connection with such transfers. Where a third party handles a payment, the payment is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of such third party (including among others payment methods, tax liability, collection and use of your personal information, and support levels). We recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy policy of such third parties before submitting any personal information and using such third parties’ services.<br>
If you submit a request to withdraw monies from your Account, such transfer may take us up to seven (7) business days to process the request, following the provision by you of all relevant identification documents that we may require from you in our sole discretion. Once the request has been approved, it may take a further seven (7) business days until the funds show in your personal account. Transfers via credit or debit card shall be performed at times and according to the card company’s procedures or according to the terms of third party payment processors used by us to complete such transfers. We may carry out withdrawal orders by alternative means to those which have been used in the original deposit order, subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations.<br>
We may, from time to time and in our sole discretion, including without limitation, after funds have been deposited into your Account and prior to any withdrawals, require you to provide proof of identity documentation, such as a notarized copy of your passport or other means of identity verification, copies of the credit card used to deposit funds, utility bill, and written confirmation of your instructions to perform activities through the Service, as we may deem necessary under the circumstances. Notwithstanding, we are not obligated to verify your identity or the validity of your instructions. You shall bear the risk of all instructions, whether authorized, unauthorized, improper or fraudulent, even if such instructions were provided without your authority. If you do not comply with our requests, we reserve the right to close any open Transactions on the Service, refund to your Account all amounts invested by you pursuant to such closed Transactions, transfer such monies from your Account to you and delete your Account.<br>
You shall be fully responsible for the payment of any taxes that apply to this Agreement, the Site or the Service. It is your responsibility to report your activities on your Account to any applicable tax or other authority, and to pay all applicable taxes, levies, governmental fees and charges associated with the activities including required deductions at source.<br>
Suspension and Termination. We may, in our sole discretion, from time to time add, remove or suspend from the Service any type of option or asset, or change or discontinue providing any part of the Service. <br>
We may, in our sole discretion and without notice or liability to you or any third party, block access to this Site or the Service from, or immediately suspend or terminate the Account of, any user that, among others: (i) we suspect is the victim of theft or unauthorized use of Registration Data; (ii) provides Registration Data that is inappropriate or offensive in our discretion, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, (iii) breaches the letter or spirit of any term of this Agreement, or (iv) whose Account has extended periods of inactivity, without derogating from any other right or remedy that we may have by law, equity or otherwise. In such an event, we may immediately close any Transactions, and debit or credit your Account as applicable, close all or any of your Accounts held with us of whatever nature, terminate this Agreement without notice and refuse to enter into further Transactions with you. Any monies held in any of your Accounts on the Site shall be frozen and we may deduct any amounts from such Accounts in order to set off any loss, damages or expenses incurred by us as a result of a breach of this Section. <br>

We will attempt to provide prior notice of scheduled maintenance but cannot guarantee that such notice will be provided. Under such circumstances, we may in our sole discretion (with or without notice) close your open Transactions at prices we consider fair and reasonable at such time, and you waive any claims or demands against us in connection thereto.</p>

Furthermore, minor differences in market prices may occur in short time periods and may cause high profits or losses in relation to transactions you complete through CATCO Trading and the services we offer.
